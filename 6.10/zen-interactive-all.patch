Subject: [PATCH] ZEN: INTERACTIVE: Enable background reclaim of hugepages

Use [defer+madvise] as default khugepaged defrag strategy:

For some reason, the default strategy to respond to THP fault fallbacks
is still just madvise, meaning stall if the program wants transparent
hugepages, but don't trigger a background reclaim / compaction if THP
begins to fail allocations.  This creates a snowball affect where we
still use the THP code paths, but we almost always fail once a system
has been active and busy for a while.

The option "defer" was created for interactive systems where THP can
still improve performance.  If we have to fallback to a regular page due
to an allocation failure or anything else, we will trigger a background
reclaim and compaction so future THP attempts succeed and previous
attempts eventually have their smaller pages combined without stalling
running applications.

We still want madvise to stall applications that explicitely want THP,
so defer+madvise _does_ make a ton of sense.  Make it the default for
interactive systems, especially if the kernel maintainer left
transparent hugepages on "always".

Subject: [PATCH] ZEN: INTERACTIVE: Tune mgLRU to protect cache used in the last
 second

Although not identical to the le9 patches that protect a byte-amount of
cache through tunables, multigenerational LRU now supports protecting
cache accessed in the last X milliseconds.

In #218, Yu recommends starting with 1000ms and tuning as needed.  This
looks like a safe default and turning on this feature should help users
that don't know they need it.

Subject: [PATCH] ZEN: INTERACTIVE: Tune ondemand governor for interactivity

4.10:
During some personal testing with the Dolphin emulator, MuQSS has
serious problems scaling its frequencies causing poor performance where
boosting the CPU frequencies would have fixed them.  Reducing the
up_threshold to 45 with MuQSS appears to fix the issue, letting the
introduction to "Star Wars: Rogue Leader" run at 100% speed versus about
80% on my test system.

Also, lets refactor the definitions and include some indentation to help
the reader discern what the scope of all the macros are.

5.4:
On the last custom kernel benchmark from Phoronix with Xanmod, Michael
configured all the kernels to run using ondemand instead of the kernel's
[default selection][1].  This reminded me that another option outside of
the kernels control is the user's choice to change the cpufreq governor,
for better or for worse.

In Liquorix, performance is the default governor whether you're running
acpi-cpufreq or intel-pstate.  I expect laptop users to install TLP or
LMT to control the power balance on their system, especially when
they're plugged in or on battery.  However, it's pretty clear to me a
lot of people would choose ondemand over performance since it's not
obvious it has huge performance ramifications with MuQSS, and ondemand
otherwise is "good enough" for most people.

Lets codify lower up thresholds for MuQSS to more closely synergize with
its aggressive thread migration behavior.  This way when ondemand is
configured, you get sort of a "performance-lite" type of result but with
the power savings you expect when leaving the running system idle.

[1]: https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=xanmod-2020-kernel

5.14:
Although CFS and similar schedulers (BMQ, PDS, and CacULE), reuse a lot
more of mainline scheduling and do a good job of pinning single threaded
tasks to their respective core, there's still applications that
confusingly run steady near 50% and benefit from going full speed or
turbo when they need to run (emulators for more recent consoles come to
mind).

Drop the up threshold for all non-MuQSS schedulers from 80/95 to 55/60.

5.15:
Remove MuQSS cpufreq configuration.

Subject: [PATCH] ZEN: INTERACTIVE: mm: Disable watermark boosting by default

What watermark boosting does is preemptively fire up kswapd to free
memory when there hasn't been an allocation failure. It does this by
increasing kswapd's high watermark goal and then firing up kswapd. The
reason why this causes freezes is because, with the increased high
watermark goal, kswapd will steal memory from processes that need it in
order to make forward progress. These processes will, in turn, try to
allocate memory again, which will cause kswapd to steal necessary pages
from those processes again, in a positive feedback loop known as page
thrashing. When page thrashing occurs, your system is essentially
livelocked until the necessary forward progress can be made to stop
processes from trying to continuously allocate memory and trigger
kswapd to steal it back.

This problem already occurs with kswapd *without* watermark boosting,
but it's usually only encountered on machines with a small amount of
memory and/or a slow CPU. Watermark boosting just makes the existing
problem worse enough to notice on higher spec'd machines.

Disable watermark boosting by default since it's a total dumpster fire.
I can't imagine why anyone would want to explicitly enable it, but the
option is there in case someone does.

Subject: [PATCH] ZEN: INTERACTIVE: mm: Lower the non-hugetlbpage pageblock size
 to reduce scheduling delays

The page allocator processes free pages in groups of pageblocks, where
the size of a pageblock is typically quite large (1024 pages without
hugetlbpage support). Pageblocks are processed atomically with the zone
lock held, which can cause severe scheduling delays on both the CPU
going through the pageblock and any other CPUs waiting to acquire the
zone lock. A frequent offender is move_freepages_block(), which is used
by rmqueue() for page allocation.

As it turns out, there's no requirement for pageblocks to be so large,
so the pageblock order can simply be reduced to ease the scheduling
delays and zone lock contention. PAGE_ALLOC_COSTLY_ORDER is used as a
reasonable setting to ensure non-costly page allocation requests can
still be serviced without always needing to free up more than one
pageblock's worth of pages at a time.

This has a noticeable effect on overall system latency when memory
pressure is elevated. The various mm functions which operate on
pageblocks no longer appear in the preemptoff tracer, where previously
they would spend up to 100 ms on a mobile arm64 CPU processing a
pageblock with preemption disabled and the zone lock held.

Subject: [PATCH] ZEN: INTERACTIVE: dm-crypt: Disable workqueues for crypto ops

Queueing in dm-crypt for crypto operations reduces performance on modern
systems.  As discussed in an article from Cloudflare, they discovered
that queuing was introduced because the crypto subsystem used to be
synchronous.  Since it's now asynchronous, we get double queueing when
using the subsystem through dm-crypt.  This is obviously undesirable and
reduces throughput and increases latency.

Disable queueing when using our Zen Interactive configuration.
